Here is a long list of links I have found since my last linkdump post.

* [AWS Cheat Sheets - Tutorials Dojo](https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheets/)
  > Useful if you are looking for an overview of the important AWS services you need to know to be able to pass different AWS certifications exams.

* [YTT TECH](https://www.ytt-tech.com/v/Drilling-Techniques-and-Tips)
  > YTT Tech exists to organize, curate, and surface the wealth of instructional content on YouTube. To be a place to discover and explore new skills and tools.

  Personally I already checked some woodworking for my next project on my cabin in the woods.

* [AHK Studio - AutoHotkey Community](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=62&t=300)
  Just found this while looking some help for my AHK scripts. Didn't try it though.

* [How to add text to a text file (encoding!) - AutoHotkey Community](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=61744)
  This list of URLs (just the URLs) is mainly created automatically by an AHK script. Last weeks I faced some issues with the encoding, this link helped me to sort this out.

* [How do I use Unicode in AutoHotKey? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15635635/how-do-i-use-unicode-in-autohotkey)

* [Hide dotfiles in Windows - Super User](https://superuser.com/questions/236939/hide-dotfiles-in-windows)
  If you you the WSL, your dotfiles (which are hidden on Linux) will be visible on Windows Explorer and is annoying, you really don't care the dotfiles when you are in windows, I think. This post provides an script file to hide those dotfiles on Windows Explorer.

* [Chess Tactics Explained in English: Ward Farnsworth's Predator at the Chessboard  ](https://www.chesstactics.org/)
  I would like to play chess more strategically, I will save this link.

  Interesting challenges

* [windows - SSH into vagrant with X server set up - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20094118/ssh-into-vagrant-with-x-server-set-up)
  I was doing some PoC's with some Oracle Databases and I decided to use Vagrant for this as there are [Vagrant projects](https://github.com/oracle/vagrant-projects) for different products releases by Oracle. In some part of my PoC I had to use the GUI, this post help me a lot.

* [fogus: The best things and stuff of 2020](http://blog.fogus.me/2020/12/31/the-best-things-and-stuff-of-2020/)
  Very inspiring reading to do a similar post, I tried, but didn't had enough inspiration, it's already February 2021 and I decided to abort mission. Anyway you can take a look on Fogus 2020 Year Overview and find interesting resources/books/urls.
