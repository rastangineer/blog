Like 2 or 3 weeks ago I found **Christoph StÃ¶ttner** blog and I realized he is keeping like a knowledge base/bookmark collection/[linkdump](https://stoeps.de/tags/linkdump/) per week and I found it very smart to keep track of what important things you visited, or just to have a place to save you bookmarks, and why not? share it to the people.

So today I'm starting my own effort to maintain my own KB, based on URL's I visited.

* [Christoph StÃ¶ttner](https://stoeps.de)

  It's basically a blog with interesting posts about Linux, ElasticSearch. Contains lots of interesting links collected weekly into linkdumps.

* ðŸ“º [[NEW 2019] How to install ORACLE DATABASE 19c on virtual machine LINUX 7.5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5SfzJeqMuk)

  Good video tutorial for installing Oracle 19c

* [Git bare repositories for dot files](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11070797)

  Very smart implementacion to version control your dotfiles configurations. I tried lots of dotfiles configurations from Internet but I always got confused with so many customizations. I decide to create mines starting from scratch.

* [Using SSH Keys in Visual Studio Code on Windows](https://www.cgranade.com/blog/2016/06/06/ssh-keys-in-vscode.html)

  For some reason I always struggle a little bit when Im configuring my ssh keys with vscode in a new laptop to clone my repos. This is the tutorial I always use as a reference.
