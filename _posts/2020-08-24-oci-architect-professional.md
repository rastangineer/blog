Last week I got certified on **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Architect Professional**. I thought the [associate](2020-05-29-oci-architect-associate.md) was a difficult one, but I was wrong.

Let's first begin with.. What does really means to be a OCI Architect Professional? Basically, it means you should be able to design and implement end-to-end solutions, either evergreen or migrations, using mainly Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

I have to be honest here, at the beginning of my preparation, I was skeptical about passing this one, because I lacked of real hands-on experience on OCI, but my previous hands-on experience on AWS was very helpful to understand OCI concepts faster, plus my OCI Architect *Associate* certification.

The hardest part of the exam, for me, **networking** and **databases**. I never liked DB's, I always thought that in certain moment of your professional career you have to specialize in a couple of areas in order to get proficient, well.. networking and DB's were not my choice at that time. Now I can say as an Architect you definitively have to know DB's, at least at a high level.

At the end I think it's about all the experience you gathered since the beginning of your first days with computers, from the very first time you learned basic network config just because you had to do it in order to be able to play Starcraft in a LAN party with your friends on college, up to the last enterprise solution you designed.

As in my previous certification I followed the same tips (taking notes, quizzes, pomodoro's, focusing, watching videos), but this time I was feeling like I was not really prepared enough. This time I tried google and found a couple of interesting links:

- [OCI Technical Whitepapers](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Reference/aqswhitepapers.htm): Very good repository with documentation about a lot of things you can do with OCI and uses cases organized by topics. So, every time I got a wrong answer on my practice exam about some specific topic I went and looked for a whitepaper related with the question I failed, so I could find docs related.

Im not a person who collects certification just by fun. I see them as investments, is like saving money, you can simply do nothing and let the time pass by, or you can take advantage of these times and learn something new and why not? Get certified.
