* [Lost internet access after reboot in my WSL environments](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/3438#issuecomment-410518578)
  
  This week I received a Windows 10 upgrade which upgraded my WSL to WSL2 also. Everything looked fine until I rebooted my machine, I noticed I lost internet in my WSL Ubuntu's. I found this link and performed the following steps:

```css
#container {
  float: left;
  margin: 0 -240px 0 0;
  width: 100%;
}
```

  ```dos
  netsh winsock reset
  netsh int ip reset all
  netsh winhttp reset proxy
  ipconfig /flushdns
  ```
  
  Then reboot Windows

  I used this little trick to improve my productivity when Im saving links and interesting stuff. Actually this is the way this file is created. Normally, I will compile a list of links using `F9` key as I browse for a week, then I edit this file, add the comments and the front matter at the top.
