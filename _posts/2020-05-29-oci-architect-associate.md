Yesterday I passed my Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Architect Associate Certification Exam. It's been the hardest exam I've taken, weeks of studying, taking notes, lot's of stress, etc but let me tell you something, the feeling of learning something is dope, very rewarding. Here are some resources / tips I used:

* ðŸ“º [Become OCI Architect (Associate) Learning Path](https://learn.oracle.com/ols/learning-path/become-oci-architect-associate/35644/75658). Video training, demos, quizzes and **practice exam**.
* ðŸ§ª [Qloudable hand-on labs](https://ocitraining.qloudable.com/learningplan/33c7d339-b420-48e7-9098-ee2c364e0f56).  Labs, videos, quizzes.
* ðŸ“˜ [OCI Architect Associate All-in-One Exam Guide](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/oracle-cloud-infrastructure/9781260452600/). This is a great book to go into deep details about OCI. It has quizzes, and a **practice exam** at the end. 

* ðŸ’¡ TIP 1: While studying **take notes** on paper/notebook, they become handy few days/hours before the exam for quick review.
* ðŸ’¡ TIP 2: After finishing a practice exam or quiz, review the questions you **failed** and take notes on paper/notebook.
* ðŸ’¡ TIP 3: Organize/Schedule the units/topics and block time in your **calendar**. So you will know your study progress.
* ðŸ’¡ TIP 4: **Get focus** while you are studying, nice background noise (sea, woods, rain, etc) might help to get focus and concentrate.
* ðŸ’¡ TIP 5: **Pomodoro** technique.
